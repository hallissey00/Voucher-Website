# Voucher-Website
  This project will develop Voucher System for Local Businesses; due to this current covid-19 pandemic, many organizations  had to close down for a definite time due to the new covid-19 guidelines that have been put on by the government. This has put huge pressure on companies from an economic point of view.

#Project Plan
As we discussed in our project, Kmal Elhaj will be designing the home page, contact page Joshua 
Olunana will do the checkout and payment page, Dylan Hallisey will do the gift cards, and the vouchers 
page also add to the basket. The application will be called VoucherCart.com. The project we will use 
HTML, PHP as our programming language. We will have UML diagrams to use some actors like 
members, login, System, etc. 
The Voucher System is an application that will enable the online customers to choose a voucher with a 
specific business, this can be for example restaurants or households assistance such as electricity, 
gardens and cleaning. The main technologies we will be using for this project will be HTML, CSS, 
PHP.

#Motivation
Our motivation for doing this project is to help small and local businesses allow their customers to buy 
vouchers for their shops online giving the fact they cannot go to the shops because of the government 
implemented restrictions.

#Goals
The main goal is to help people buy vouchers from their local shop online, and be able to redeem the 
vouchers when they need it.

#System Analysis
The aim of this chapter is exactly what is the application supposed to do? This should be done by 
talking about the contract between the software developers and the clients. This chapter we will talk 
about the functional requirements and data requirements.
Functional Requirements
To complete this project, we plan on using JavaScript, JSON, HTML, CSS, and PHP. We are 
implemented an application voucher system. It should have a Home Page, About Page, and Contact 
Page. For the Home page, it should have an option for the customer to decide where they would like to 
shop. The customers should be able to select their choice. The customer then would click on the select 
button, and the choices should come up. 
The functionality for each page:

Register Page – This will let any customers register for the website, so to use the service. They will 
need their name email and password.
